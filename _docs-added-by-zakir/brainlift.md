# Studying the Codebase

Me to Gemini 2.5 Pro:
Deep dive through the codebase and only look at the readme files in each folder. Do not look at the actual code, only look at the readme files in each folder. And then come back with what you learned and add it to my high-level overview document in an easy-understand way so that I can understand this codebase before I add new features to it. I am a software engineer.

The output is in the file codebase_overview.md.


Me to Gemini 2.5 Pro:
Please write a markdown document discussing the tech stack of this codebase. 

The output was added to codebase_overview.md.


# Exploratory conversations

Me to ChatGPT 4o:
what is LibreOffice

ChatGPT 4o:
LibreOffice is a free and open-source office suite developed by The Document Foundation. It’s similar to Microsoft Office and includes several powerful applications for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and more.

Here's a quick breakdown of the main components:

Writer – Word processor (like Microsoft Word)

Calc – Spreadsheet application (like Excel)

Impress – Presentation tool (like PowerPoint)

Draw – Vector graphics and diagramming tool (like Visio)

Base – Database management system (like Access)

Math – Formula and equation editor

LibreOffice runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It uses the Open Document Format (ODF) by default but can also open and save Microsoft Office file formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.).

Because it’s open-source, anyone can modify the source code. This makes it a great choice for custom projects—like your idea of tailoring it to a specific niche.
